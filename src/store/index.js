pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\n[03:15.000]It's me, my honesty's brutal\n[03:17.720]But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\n[03:20.580]For good at least once in a while\n[03:21.980]So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\n[03:24.520]Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times\n[03:27.720]But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned\n[03:30.880]Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\n[03:33.250]I know there was a time where once I\n[03:35.010]Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\n[03:38.230]So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\n[03:40.280]Appeal with the skin color of mine\n[03:42.150]You get too big and here they come trying to censor you\n[03:44.550]Like that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from the Marshall Mathers LP\n[03:47.260]One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine\n[03:50.090]Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\n[03:53.870]See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal\n[03:59.960]You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though\n[04:01.990]And I don't know what the **** that you rhyme for\n[04:04.190]You're pointless as Rapunzel with ****ing cornrows\n[04:06.730]You're like normal, **** being normal\n[04:08.520]And I just bought a new Raygun from the future\n[04:10.570]To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n[04:13.100]Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad\n[04:15.050]Singin' to a man while they played piano\n[04:16.580]Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\n[04:19.740]So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\n[04:22.550]''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''\n[04:23.770]Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)\n[04:25.920]Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human\n[04:28.030]What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\n[04:29.300]Innovative and I'm made of rubber\n[04:30.440]So that anything you saying is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you\n[04:32.500]I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating\n[04:34.110]How to give a mother****in' audience a feeling like it's levitating\n[04:35.740]Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\n[04:37.640]For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\n[04:39.200]Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\n[04:40.470]I make elevating music, you make elevator music\n[04:42.700]Oh, he's too mainstream\n[04:43.780]Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n[04:46.090]It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it\n[04:48.710]With rock, shock rap with Doc\n[04:50.720]Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n[04:52.600]I don't know how to make songs like that\n[04:53.920]I don't know what words to use\n[04:55.410]Let me know when it occurs to you\n[04:56.790]While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\n[04:58.410]It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you\n[05:00.090]How many verses I gotta murder to prove\n[05:01.580]That if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too\n[05:05.230]School flunkie, pill junky\n[05:07.390]But look at the accolades the skills brung me\n[05:09.940]Full of myself, but still hungry\n[05:11.810]I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to\n[05:14.630]And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\n[05:18.270]But it's still tongue in cheek, **** you\n[05:20.060]I'm drunk so Satan take the ****ing wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\n[05:23.710]Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\n[05:26.210]But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\n[05:29.940]Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me\n[05:33.460]They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\n[05:35.220]But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had\n[05:37.340]Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\n[05:40.200]And understand the discrimation\n[05:42.200]But **** it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\n[05:45.070]But if I can't batter the women how the **** am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\n[05:48.740]Don't mistake it for Satan\n[05:49.980]It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\n[05:52.020]And take a vacation to trip a broad\n[05:53.950]And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\n[05:56.670]Be a king? Think not—why be a king when you can be a God?`,

have\n[02:33.960]Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy\n[02:35.750]Basically boy you're never gonna be capable\n[02:37.780]To keep up with the same pace looking boy\n[02:39.090]Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\n[02:42.360]All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\n[02:45.520]The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar\n[02:48.720]Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\n[02:51.480]Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard\n[02:55.200]So you be Thor and I'll be Odin\n[02:56.840]You rodent, I'm omnipotent\n[02:58.980]Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'\n[03:01.880]And I should not be woken\n[03:03.840]I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating\n[03:07.010]But I got your mom deep throating\n[03:08.570]I'm out my ramen noodle\n[03:09.850]We have nothing in common, poodle\n[03:11.450]I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\n[03:15.000]It's me, my honesty's brutal\n[03:17.720]But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\n[03:20.580]For good at least once in a while\n[03:21.980]So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\n[03:24.520]Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times\n[03:27.720]But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned\n[03:30.880]Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\n[03:33.250]I know there was a time where once I\n[03:35.010]Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\n[03:38.230]So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\n[03:40.280]Appeal with the skin color of mine\n[03:42.150]You get too big and here they come trying to censor you\n[03:44.550]Like that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from the Marshall Mathers LP\n[03:47.260]One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine\n[03:50.090]Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\n[03:53.870]See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal\n[03:59.960]You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though\n[04:01.990]And I don't know what the **** that you rhyme for\n[04:04.190]You're pointless as Rapunzel with ****ing cornrows\n[04:06.730]You're like normal, **** being normal\n[04:08.520]And I just bought a new Raygun from the future\n[04:10.570]To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n[04:13.100]Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad\n[04:15.050]Singin' to a man while they played piano\n[04:16.580]Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\n[04:19.740]So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\n[04:22.550]''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''\n[04:23.770]Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)\n[04:25.920]Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human\n[04:28.030]What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\n[04:29.300]Innovative and I'm made of rubber\n[04:30.440]So that anything you saying is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you\n[04:32.500]I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating\n[04:34.110]How to give a mother****in' audience a feeling like it's levitating\n[04:35.740]Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\n[04:37.640]For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\n[04:39.200]Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\n[04:40.470]I make elevating music, you make elevator music\n[04:42.700]Oh, he's too mainstream\n[04:43.780]Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n[04:46.090]It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it\n[04:48.710]With rock, shock rap with Doc\n[04:50.720]Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n[04:52.600]I don't know how to make songs like that\n[04:53.920]I don't know what words to use\n[04:55.410]Let me know when it occurs to you\n[04:56.790]While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\n[04:58.410]It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you\n[05:00.090]How many verses I gotta murder to prove\n[05:01.580]That if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too\n[05:05.230]School flunkie, pill junky\n[05:07.390]But look at the accolades the skills brung me\n[05:09.940]Full of myself, but still hungry\n[05:11.810]I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to\n[05:14.630]And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\n[05:18.270]But it's still tongue in cheek, **** you\n[05:20.060]I'm drunk so Satan take the ****ing wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\n[05:23.710]Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\n[05:26.210]But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\n[05:29.940]Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me\n[05:33.460]They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\n[05:35.220]But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had\n[05:37.340]Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\n[05:40.200]And understand the discrimation\n[05:42.200]But **** it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\n[05:45.070]But if I can't batter the women how the **** am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\n[05:48.740]Don't mistake it for Satan\n[05:49.980]It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\n[05:52.020]And take a vacation to trip a broad\n[05:53.950]And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\n[05:56.670]Be a king? Think not—why be a king when you can be a God?`,
